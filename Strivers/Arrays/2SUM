WHEN SORTED ARRAY USE TWO POINTERS BUT WHEN UNSORTED USE HASHMAP


Great question 👏

Let’s compare the two main approaches for **Two Sum**:

---

### 🔹 Approach 1: **HashMap (O(n))**

* Traverse array once.
* For each number, check if `target - num` is already seen.
* If yes → return indices.
* Time: **O(n)**
* Space: **O(n)** (map stores elements).

👉 This is the **most optimized** for the classic **unsorted array** version.

---

### 🔹 Approach 2: **Sort + Two Pointers**

* Create an array of pairs `{value, index}`.
* Sort by value → **O(n log n)**.
* Apply two pointers → **O(n)**.
* Time: **O(n log n)**
* Space: **O(n)** (for storing value-index pairs).

👉 This is slower than HashMap because sorting dominates.

---

✅ **Which is considered optimized?**

* If the input is **unsorted** (like LeetCode’s Two Sum) → **HashMap is better** (O(n) vs O(n log n)).
* If the input is **already sorted** → Two pointers is the best (O(n), O(1) extra space).

---

💡 So, **sorting + two pointers is not the optimal solution** for the classic Two Sum. It’s only optimal if the input is guaranteed sorted (sometimes a variation called “Two Sum II: Input Array is Sorted”).

Do you want me to also show you how **Two Sum II (sorted array)** looks different from normal **Two Sum**?
