APPROACH 1:
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d={}
        for i in range(len(nums)+1):

            d[i]=0
        for i in nums:
            d[i]+=1
        for k in d:
            if d[k]==0:
                return k
        


APPROACH 2:

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        #sum of natural numbers - sum of array nums
        N=len(nums)
        summation=(N*(N+1))//2
        a=sum(nums)
        missing=summation-a
        return missing
        


IN THIS Q WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RANGE THAT IS THE SIZE OF THE ARRAY NOT THE MAX ELEMENT IS TREATED AS THE RANGE
