counting digits
x = int(input("Enter a number:"))
count = 0
while x >0:
    temp = x % 10
    x = x // 10   # if u write / it makes the whole code wrong
    # just this simple thing if not understood can cause serious errors
    count += 1

print("Number of digits : ", count)




JAVA CODE
class Solution {
    public int countDigit(int n)
    { 
        if(n==0) return 1;    //edge case we might miss
        int count=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            n=n/10;
            count+=1;

        }
        return count;

    }
}


TC : since number gets divided by 10 every iteration so we need to take that into account hence tc becomes : O(logn)
10ᵏ ≈ n
k = log₁₀(n)
