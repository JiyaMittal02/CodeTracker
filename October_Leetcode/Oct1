            max_bottle+=numBottles//numExchange
            remaining_Empty_Bottles=numBottles%numExchange
            remaining_Empty_Bottles+=(numBottles//numExchange)
            numBottles=remaining_Empty_Bottles
        return max_bottle

O(logn) because we are reducing numbottles by halfing it each time
since reduction is not linear that is why tc is logn otherwise if it was by some fixed value using subtraction tc would have been O(n)
