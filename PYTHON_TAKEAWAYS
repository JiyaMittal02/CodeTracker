-- sort() returns None and does sorting in-place so writing set(nums.sort) gives error because machine sees it as set(None)
-- sorted() another function that sorts and returns a new list
-- If you wish to traverse backwards in a loop STEP is mandatory without it the code doesn't work
-- reverse, reversed, slicing are methods for reversal
-- SET is part of unordered collections hence it does not ALLOW ACCESSING RANDOM ELEMENTS LIKE WE DO THROUGH LISTS s[0] not allowed
-- SORTED converts every ds to list

-- TC OF SOME INBUILT
min, max, sum = O(n) on a collection.

len = O(1).

sorted = O(n log n).

in = depends on container (list → O(n), set/dict → O(1)).
